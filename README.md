# Leave-Management
Description:

I am excited to share a project that I developed called the "Leave Management System." This system is designed to streamline and automate the process of managing employee leaves and approvals within an organization. It allows employees to apply for different types of leaves (casual and medical), view their leave balances, and submit leave requests. Managers can review and approve leave applications using the system.

Features:

Employee Portal: Employees can log in to the system and perform the following actions:

Add their details to the system, including unique ID, name, age, experience, and department.
Apply for leaves by selecting the type of leave (casual or medical) and specifying the start and end dates.
View their leave balances, including the number of casual and medical leaves available.
Manager Portal: Managers can access the system to perform the following tasks:

Approve leaves requested by employees.
Delete employee records from the system if necessary.
Data Storage: Employee and leave data is stored in binary files to ensure data persistence and privacy.
